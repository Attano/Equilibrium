- Bringing stuff up to speed(main 4v4 cfg only - for now):

> Completely reorganized the cvars. Native and SM cvars should not be mixed, unless it is vital for a better perception.
> Replaced l4d2_nospitterduringtank with l4d2_spitter_manager
> Added Texture Manager Blocker plugin
> Replaced l4d2_si_slowdown with l4d2_slowdown_control. Also more intuitive cvars.
> Added an optimized version of Riot Cop Headshot plugin
> Moved the witch enrage/FF-related code from l4d_witch_damage_announce into l4d2_si_ffblock
> Added the Drop Secondary plugin. Dead Survivors drop their melee weapons.
> Added the Tank Pain Fade plugin. Red screen fades for Tanks getting melee owned from behind.
> Added the Undo Survivor Friendly-Fire plugin. Removed a ton of unrelated stuff, still looks like a mess. But works.
> Added the Scout Precache plugin. Weapon Limits will handle what was once done by l4d_sniper.
> Added the Weapon Attributes plugin for some Scout tweaks.
> Replaced Scoremod with EQ2.0 Scoremod. Details on the forums.
> Added melee limits. 3 per team will stay as the default value for EQ2.0 4v4 for now.
> Added the Starting Bacteria plugin. First set of spawns for each team will be vocalized via the oldschool "bacteria" sounds. Only Survivors are able to hear them though.

- Stripper:

> Added the latest set of map changes from ProMod/Customogl 3.3.3.
> Removed inaccessible pills in a room next to the panic event on DK4.
> Blocked elevator walls on HR2-3. SI can no longer scratch through them.
