- Bringing stuff up to speed(main 4v4 cfg only - for now):

> Completely reorganized the cvars. Native and SM cvars should not be mixed, unless it is vital for a better perception.
> Replaced l4d2_nospitterduringtank with l4d2_spitter_manager
> Added Texture Manager Blocker plugin
> Replaced l4d2_si_slowdown with l4d2_slowdown_control. Also more intuitive cvars.
> Added an optimized version of Riot Cop Headshot plugin
> Moved the witch enrage/FF-related code from l4d_witch_damage_announce into l4d2_si_ffblock
> Added the Drop Secondary plugin. Dead Survivors drop their melee weapons.
> Added the Tank Pain Fade plugin. Red screen fades for Tanks getting melee owned from behind.
> Added the Undo Survivor Friendly-Fire plugin. Removed a ton of unrelated stuff, still looks like a mess. But works.
> Added the Scout Precache plugin. Weapon Limits will handle what was once done by l4d_sniper.
> Added the Weapon Attributes plugin for some Scout tweaks.
> Replaced Scoremod with EQ2.0 Scoremod. Details on the forums.
> Added melee limits. 3 per team will stay as the default value for EQ2.0 4v4 for now.
> Added the Starting Bacteria plugin. First set of spawns for each team will be vocalized via the oldschool "bacteria" sounds. Only Survivors are able to hear them though.

- Stripper:

> Added the latest set of map changes from ProMod/Customogl 3.3.3.
> Removed inaccessible pills in a room next to the panic event on DK4.
> Blocked elevator walls on HR2-3. SI can no longer scratch through them.

[!] NOTE: Warcelona campaign issues fixes and Global Boss Coordinates Equalizer are still work in progress. Check later for updates.
[!] NOTE: 3v3 and 2v2 configs are still being worked on. Please do not install them, for now.

> Fixed identation issues in all files
> Added missing l4d2_spitter_manager
> Added static shotgun spread into the config, with its files and the updated Left4Downtown2 extension. It is NOT the same as the one in Jahze's repo, so update it! It is required for water slowdown and stagger fix plugins.
Chrome: 15 pellets / 17 dmg / pellet scatter values 3.0 / 3.0
Pump: 17 pellets / 15 dmg / pellet scatter values 3.5 / 3.5 (less accurate than chrome)
> Slowdown Control plugin has been revised. Now it's using EQ2.0's custom Left4Downtown2 extension as a dependency to handle water slowdown for the Survivors and the Tank. Confogl's own slowdown is turned off, since the new function is much less consuming on higher tickrates.
> Added a plugin to remove friendly charger staggers. No more ruined caps!
> Added a plugin to remove hunter deadstops. Ground hunters can still be shoved though.
> Improved the Tank Lottery algorithm. Now substitutes will be placed at the back of the tank lottery queue. This way, players that have joined the game earlier will remain 100% eligible for becoming a tank.
> All finales now have only two event tanks. Distance-based tanks, as well as those that accompany the rescue vehicles, will be blocked.
> Added an improved Bot Pop Stop plugin. It relies on the latest Left4Downtown2 extension. Instead of taking the pills away from bots, it blocks them from using them altogether.
> Revised, fixed and improved the EQ2 Scoremod system.
